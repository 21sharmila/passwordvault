Password Vault is a secure web application built using Python, Django, and SQL that allows users to safely store, manage, and retrieve their passwords. It focuses on providing strong security, efficiency, and ease of use through encrypted password storage and a clean, responsive user interface. Users can register, log in, and perform CRUD operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting credentials securely. The system ensures that all passwords are encrypted before being saved in the database, along with strong password validation and session management for enhanced protection. Installation involves setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, applying database migrations, and running the Django server. Future enhancements include implementing two-factor authentication (2FA), integrating a password generator tool, and enabling secure export and import of stored credentials.
